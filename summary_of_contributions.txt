  	-interests:

 			-queries searched for groups with that interest and upcoming events and displayed on the page
 		display some interests on the public page --> which if clicked on go to an interest page
 	-groups:
 		page for a group
 			-queries searched for the group's interest and upcoming events from that group
 	-friends:
 		page for members
 			-much like the home page of the user, the member page is denoted by the url "/friends/<username>"
 			-queries were created to display friends of that member and their corresponding upcoming events
 			-a special query was done to check if this user was a friend of the user that was logged in, if not the logged-in-user can choose to add this user as a friend via the "add friend" button; once clicked the logged-in-user gets added to the friend table as 'friend_of' and the user (who's page they are on) is added as 'friend_to'; the button then changes from "add friend" to "✓friends" 
 	-theme:
 		member table
 			-color column was added to the member table as a char(6) and default 000000
 			-the member can set this variable to whatever hex value they want when they register
 			-the corresponding color will appear as the color of their name due to the addition of css code on the home page
 	-events:
 		-added upcoming events to the index page
